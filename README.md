# Project Title: Securing SOHO Network

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to enhance the security of a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network by implementing several critical measures. These measures include changing default passwords, updating the SSID, enabling WPA3 security, and implementing MAC filtering.

## Project Flow

1. **Assessment and Planning**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Identify the current configuration of the SOHO router.
     - Gather necessary documentation on the router's settings and capabilities.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Comprehensive understanding of current network security posture.
   - **Advantages**: Provides a baseline for security improvements and helps in identifying existing vulnerabilities.

2. **Change Default Administrator Password**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Access the router's admin interface.
     - Locate the password change option.
     - Set a strong, unique administrator password.

   - **Expected Outcome**: Enhanced security through the elimination of default credentials.
   - **Advantages**: Prevents unauthorized access to the routerâ€™s settings, reducing the risk of network compromise.

3. **Change Default Service Set Identifier (SSID)**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Access the wireless settings in the router admin interface.
     - Change the SSID from the default to a unique name that does not disclose the router brand or model.

   - **Expected Outcome**: Improved wireless security by making it less obvious what device is in use.
   - **Advantages**: Reduces the likelihood of targeted attacks based on easily identifiable default SSIDs.

4. **Enable WPA3 Personal Security Protocol**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Navigate to the security settings of the router.
     - Select WPA3 Personal as the security protocol.
     - Set a strong passphrase (at least 12-16 characters, combining upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols).
     - <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8b04b1a-2086-4ca5-9e7c-02d43a8c661c" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Default Passwd"/><br>
   - **Expected Outcome**: Enhanced wireless security, protecting the network against unauthorized access.
   - **Advantages**: WPA3 provides better encryption and protection against brute-force attacks compared to older protocols like WPA2.

5. **Enable MAC Filtering**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Access the MAC filtering settings in the router admin interface.
     - Compile a list of MAC addresses for allowed devices.
     - Enable MAC filtering and add the identified devices to the allowed list.

   - **Expected Outcome**: Increased control over which devices can connect to the network.
   - **Advantages**: Limits access to the network to only known devices, adding an additional layer of security.

6. **Testing and Verification**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Verify that the new administrator password is effective.
     - Check that the SSID change is reflected and properly set.
     - Test connectivity with devices using the new WPA3 passphrase.
     - Confirm that only allowed MAC addresses can connect to the network.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Assurance that security measures are functioning as intended.
   - **Advantages**: Ensures that implemented changes work effectively and that vulnerabilities are addressed.

7. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Document all changes made to the router settings.
     - Create a report outlining the changes, their importance, and any future recommendations.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Detailed records of security enhancements for future reference and audits.
   - **Advantages**: Provides transparency and aids in maintaining security protocols over time.

8. **Ongoing Maintenance and Monitoring**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Schedule regular reviews of router settings and connected devices.
     - Update the passphrase and MAC filtering list as needed.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Continuous improvement of network security posture.
   - **Advantages**: Ensures the network remains secure against evolving threats and that security practices are regularly updated.
